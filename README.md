# CV - Roberto Recalde
.NET Senior developer.

## Some developments
To see what I've recently developed, please follow these links:  

.NET 6 API: [CICD API](https://github.com/rlrecalde/CICD_API) (main application for my CI/CD system).  
Powershell script: [Dockerizer](https://github.com/rlrecalde/Dockerizer) (script which works with the API for deploying a .NET Core application into a Docker Container).  
Angular 9 SPA: [CICD Web](https://github.com/rlrecalde/CICD_Web) (web UI for the API).  

Also, see PDF documents on [CICD API](https://github.com/rlrecalde/CICD_API) and [CICD Web](https://github.com/rlrecalde/CICD_Web) that explain my best practices for those developments.
